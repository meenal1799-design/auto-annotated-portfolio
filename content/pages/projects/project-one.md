This program delivered a suite of AWS security connectors that simplified
enterprise onboarding and reduced implementation time. I partnered with
engineering, sales, and AWS stakeholders to define the roadmap, prioritized
high-impact integrations, and shipped across multiple customer segments.

Key outcomes included a $4.5M product portfolio, stronger AWS partnership
alignment, and a repeatable release process that improved time to market.

Highlights:
- 15+ connectors delivered across security platforms
- 80% reduction in manual effort via automation
- Funding secured through AWS proposals and technical documentation

If you want a deeper walkthrough of discovery, prioritization, or technical
architecture, I am happy to share more details.
