At ACT Fibernet, I owned growth strategy across acquisition and onboarding,
partnering with marketing, engineering, and analytics to design and test
conversion improvements.

Results included a 7% conversion lift, 10% customer acquisition growth, and
expansion of the active user base by 200,000+.

Highlights:
- Roadmapped experiments across onboarding and activation
- Coordinated 10+ member external team and multi-department stakeholders
- Managed a 600K AED annual budget
