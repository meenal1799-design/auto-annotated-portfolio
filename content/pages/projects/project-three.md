This initiative focused on automating data analysis and reporting to support
faster decision-making. I led discovery, defined the product scope, and worked
with engineering and data science teams to deliver a reliable AI workflow.

Outcomes included 30% improvement in analysis efficiency and measurable gains
in stakeholder satisfaction due to faster insight delivery.

Highlights:
- AI-powered automation for recurring analysis tasks
- Standardized reporting for enterprise leadership
- Cross-functional alignment across product, data, and engineering

If you'd like to see a case study or demo flow, I can share a walkthrough.
